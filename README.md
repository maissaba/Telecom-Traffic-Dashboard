# Telecom Traffic Dashboard: Optimizing Revenue Assurance Controls

This project implements a **Big Data architecture** designed to manage and analyze **telecom network traffic** to optimize **revenue assurance controls**. The system processes large volumes of network traffic data using **ETL pipelines** and provides real-time insights through a **Power BI dashboard**. 

### Key Technologies and Tools:
1. **ETL Pipeline & Data Processing**:
   - **Apache NiFi**: Used for orchestrating the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform ) process. NiFi helps automate data ingestion, transformation, and routing from various sources to a central data repository.
   - **PySpark**: Used for processing large-scale telecom data, including data transformation, aggregation, and analytics on distributed systems.
   
2. **Dashboard**:
   - **Power BI**: An interactive data visualization tool used to create dashboards displaying key telecom network metrics, such as traffic volumes, anomaly detection, and revenue assurance insights.

## Project Overview

The project optimizes revenue assurance by:
- Collecting network traffic data using **Apache NiFi** for ingestion.
- Transforming and processing large volumes of data using **PySpark** for real-time analysis.
- Visualizing the data through a **Power BI** dashboard that helps telecom operators monitor and manage network traffic.

## Technologies Used

- **ETL & Data Processing**: 
  - **Apache NiFi**: For data ingestion, transformation, and orchestration.
  - **PySpark**: For data processing and transformations on distributed systems (Hadoop/Spark).
  
- **Data Storage & Processing**: 
  - **Hadoop** or **Spark**: For distributed data processing and storage.

- **Visualization**:
  - **Power BI**: For creating interactive reports and dashboards.

## Key Features

- **ETL Pipeline**: 
  - Data ingestion from multiple sources using **Apache NiFi**.
  - Data processing and transformation using **PySpark** for scalable and distributed data processing.

- **Revenue Assurance Monitoring**:
  - Analyze telecom network traffic and identify potential revenue leakage or fraud patterns.

- **Power BI Dashboard**:
  - Visual representation of network performance, traffic volume trends, and anomaly detection.
  - Real-time insights into telecom traffic that help optimize revenue assurance controls.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project comes from telecom network traffic logs. This data is used to analyze network performance, identify anomalies, and optimize revenue assurance controls.
